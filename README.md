# NewGen Studio

This repository contains the source for the NewGen Studio website.

This README is a temporary placeholder to trigger an initial deployment on Vercel. Replace this file with your actual site code (or add files) when ready.

What this is:
- Placeholder README to confirm the repository is connected to Vercel and to trigger a deploy.

Next steps after adding this file:
1. Commit this file to the `main` branch with the commit message: "Add README".
2. Wait ~1–2 minutes and then check the Vercel project Deployments page — a new deployment should appear.
3. Once deployed, visit https://www.newgenaistudio.com in a private/incognito window to confirm the site loads.
